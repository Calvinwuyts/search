        <h1>Exploring Europeana Through Social Networks - The Dutch Golden Age</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction: Hacking the Golden Age Social Graph</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Background</h3>
            <p><a href="http://144.76.218.176:8000/remfriends/Agents">This site</a> represents a refactoring of the social graph developed during the first
                Europeana Hackweek, 20-24th June, by Pablo Uceda Gomez, Tim Hill, Hugo Manguinhas, and
                Karl Pineau.</p>
            <p>The motivation for developing a social graph was that Europeana will in the near future be
            moving away from a record-oriented architecture for its data, towards the development of a knowledge
            graph. During the Hack Week we decided to see how much of a knowledge graph we could create in a
            short span of time - and what kind of effect this could have on how Europeana is explored and
            used.</p>
                </section>
            <section><h3>Why a social graph?</h3>
            <p>We decided in the first instance to focus specifically on a <em>social</em> graph because this
                seemed both valuable and feasible. Art history is to a large extent a story of the interactions of
            groups and individuals with each other, and of their influence upon each other. And while other approaches might have
            been taken (for instance, an artwork- rather than artist-centred perspective), the nature of art-cataloguing
            and the complexities of subsequent copying, reprinting, etc. meant that historical agents rather than
            their creations seemed like a more rewarding path to pursue; much bibliographic work will need to be done
            before major works of art can be considered digitally-coherent objects. Furthermore, social networks, in contrast to,
            say, FRBR Works, are an intuitive notion for most users: the effect of adding a social graph to Europeana's
            collections is more immediately clear than reorganization of artworks into, say, FRBR Works.</p>
                <p>As a sidenote: one <b>unintuitive</b> aspect of the site is that such individuals are instances of
                the Europeana Data Model Agent (edm:Agent) class, and are therefore often referred to as 'Agents' throughout
                this site. Although in theory the word 'Agent' can also apply to organisations as well as individuals,
                on this site the term is used only in reference to individual human beings.</p>
                </section>
            <section><h3>Why the Dutch Golden Age? Why Rembrandt?</h3>
            <p>In terms of time-period and milieu, we decided to focus on the Dutch Golden Age - partly because of
            the intrinsic interest of the subject, and partly because the metadata supplied to us for this period
            by the Rijksmuseum is of exceptionally good quality. We further decided to restrict our scope to Rembrandt van Rijn,
            and the social network radiating out from him. Restricting the dataset in this way seemed useful for
            experimental and evaluative purposes; and in fact even with this restricted scope, our final dataset contains more than
            1450 Agents, spanning five centuries and ranging in their birthplace from the Netherlands to Mughal India.</p>
                </section>
            <section><h3>Why a second site?</h3>
            <p>Although during the Hack Week we succeeded in creating a usable social graph, the resulting site suffered from a
            number of problems. First, the sheer number of images involved and the density of the graph made loading and response times extremely
            slow. Second, the points of linkage between this graph and Europeana, although present, were left largely implicit, so that
            it may have appeared to be something of a free-floating structure.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this site, then, is to give a better sense of how the migration of our data from a document- to
                a graph-based model will affect the Europeana platform, by making the demo site more usable and by tying it in
                more closely to Europeana Collections as it exists today. A secondary purpose is to help illuminate the Dutch Golden
                Age a little better - for even at this small a scale, and in this limited a working time-frame, the social
                networks we created helped shed an unusual light upon the period and its arists.</p>

        <h2>Using the site</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Use of the site as it exists now should be, it is hoped, self-explanatory. The start-page allows filtration of the
        Agent-list by profession (e.g., 'Sculptor', 'Midwife', 'Merchant'), with the default value set to 'Painters'. The
        resulting list can be ordered by number of social relations, by birthdate, or alphabetically.</p>
                <p>In addition, the social relations associated with each Agent can be revealed by clicking on their 'Show
                Relations' label. The resulting display is nested, so that these relations can in turn have <em>their</em>
                    relations expanded, and so on. This is an experimental feature, based on the intuition that one
                    best comes to understand a graph by traversing it. As far as we're aware this is an entirely original
                    approach to displaying and understanding social graphs. Whether it is also a useful one is a
                question left to the user's discretion.</p>
                <p>Clicking on an Agent name opens up that Agent's entity page in a new tab. This page contains at the very least
                information drawn from Wikidata about the Agent and a link back to the Agent's Wikidata page. More often
                it will also show an image of the Agent, a link to hits for that Agent in Europeana and/or the Rijskmuseum,
                and to any other paintings of that Agent in Europeana collections.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Problems and caveats</h3>
                <p>The most basic problem encountered by the first version of the site remains unchanged: the sheer number
                of images involved, and their high quality, means that page load times are long. This is mitigated to a
                large extent by the capacity to filter by profession, meaning that not all images need to be displayed
                at once. But the site is still a relatively slow one, and pages may take 4-8 seconds to render.</p>
                <p>In addition, the purpose of this second site is specifically to showcase the work achieved during
                    the Hack Week, not to add to it or correct it. This means that some data problems remain, and have
                been deliberately left un-ironed out. For instance, the various linking algorithms became confused by the
                number of Agents with the name 'Jan Six' (all of whom are related to each other), meaning that there are
                multiple wrong hits for this family. In addition, while linking back to Europeana using a phrase search of the
                Agent's full name generally yielded surprisingly good results, instances in which this results in incorrect
                hits have been allowed to stand.</p>
                <p>Finally, working on this has been a sporadic evenings-and-weekends project since the Hack week. Numerous small
                bugs, typos, HTML/CSS infelicities etc. no doubt exist. Please do point them out to <a href="mailto:timothy.hill@europeana.eu">Timothy Hill</a>
                when you find them.</p>

            <h2>Questions addressed</h2>
            <p>A full account of the Hack Week, the procedures used, and lessons learned, will be written up in the near
            future (i.e., by 31.12.2016). In the meantime, here are a few high-level observations:</p>
            <section>
                <h3>How hard is it to create a useable knowledge graph?</h3>
                <p>As it turned out, creating the knowledge graph that powers the site was relatively easy. First, the
                relevant identifiers were harvested from our Rijksmuseum data (that is to say, all the Agents who
                appeared in the metadata of any painting involving Rembrandt van Rijn). These identifiers were then
                mapped to Wikidata identifiers using BabelNet, and Wikidata was queried for five degrees of
                social-graph separation from this initial set. None of these steps was particularly challenging.</p>
                <p>The difficult part was linking this knowledge graph back to Europeana holdings. Paintings from this
                era are known under so many different names, and the Wikidata knowledge graph is so sparse here, that exact
                    semantic matching from Wikidata paintings to Europeana paintings, or from Agents to Europeana records,
                    had only very limited success in the time available during the Hack Week.
                </p>
                <p>Curiously, however, simple phrase-searching served to link Agents to Europeana records very well in
                most cases. A more thorough assessment will have to be done in future. But by and large linking of an Agent
                back to Europeana records could be accomplished through the simple expedient of double-quoting his or her name as a
                phrase search against the portal.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Just how useful is Wikidata anyway?</h3>
                <p>Although a more thorough assessment will have to be made here, the main findings with regard to
                Wikidata were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As a social-graph generator it is incredibly useful, and well-populated for Agents of this period. </li>
                    <li>its assertions can often be idiosyncratic. For instance, many of the Agents listed in Wikidata as having
                    artistic or intellectual professions (painter, sculptor, poet, etc.) are in fact titled
                    noblemen and -women who counted these amongst their cultural accomplishments. Typically little is known
                    about their work, and none of it survives. While the labelling is not incorrect and sheds interesting light upon,
                    for instance, women's history during the period, in most cases such information is not what the user
                    had in mind when filtering for, e.g., 'Poets'.</li>
                    <li>Linkage of artists to their works is (very) sparse. Rembrandt himself, for instance, is linked to only five known artistic works.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Did anything weird show up?</h3>
                <p>A couple of things!</p>
                <p>First, attempts to find instances of Agents appearing as subjects of paintings surfaced the fact that the
                 model for the Prodigal Son's (prostitute?) companion in Rembrandt's <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200105/BibliographicResource_3000006113568.html">
                        eponymous painting</a> was probably
                his wife, <a href="http://144.76.218.178:8000/remfriends/Agent/Q109676">Saskia van Uylenburgh</a>.</p>
                <p>Second, preliminary inspection of the social graph indicated a large cluster of individuals who were born
                and died in India. As it turned out, this apparent bug arose because of Rembrandt's sketch of <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/RP_T_1961_82.html">
                        De Groot Mogol Jahangir</a>, a figure who apparently fascinated Rembrandt and whose likeness he copied
                from earlier images of the prince. In addition to shedding light upon Rembrandt and his working process itself,
                the resulting social graph and its links back to Europeana indicated that we hold surprising amounts of Indian
                content related to the period.</p>
